*Overloading must be the key to golf.*

Neon is a stack-based golfing language written in Python 3.

## Philosophy

*Every possible error is just a wasted opportunity to do something useful.*

Neon was created with one purpose in mind: overloads. Essentially, each command implemented in Neon should work for any data type combination it can possibly get.
